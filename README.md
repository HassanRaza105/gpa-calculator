# 🎓 AI-Generated GPA Calculator – Web Application  

## 📌 About the Project  
This **GPA Calculator Web App** was originally a **C++ program** that I converted into a **web application** using **AI tools like GPT**. It allows students to:  
✅ Enter marks for multiple subjects  
✅ Calculate **percentage and GPA**  
✅ Assign grades based on university grading policies  

This project showcases the power of **AI-assisted development** and how it can help speed up the transition from console-based programs to **modern web applications**.
